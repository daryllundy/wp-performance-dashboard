# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The WordPress Performance Dashboard README contains several technical inaccuracies and inconsistencies that need to be corrected to ensure users can successfully install, configure, and use the application. The analysis revealed missing dependencies, incorrect file references, outdated configuration examples, and inconsistent documentation that could lead to setup failures and user confusion.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the WordPress Performance Dashboard, I want accurate dependency information so that I can install all required packages without encountering missing dependency errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the package.json dependencies THEN the README SHALL list all required dependencies accurately
2. WHEN the src/server.js file uses helmet and cors packages THEN these dependencies SHALL be included in package.json
3. WHEN dependencies are listed in the README THEN they SHALL match the exact versions specified in package.json
4. WHEN new dependencies are added to the codebase THEN the README SHALL be updated to reflect these changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user following the installation guide, I want correct file references so that I can complete the setup process without encountering missing file errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the README references .env.example THEN this file SHALL exist in the repository OR the README SHALL reference the correct file name
2. WHEN the README mentions symlinked files THEN the actual file structure SHALL be accurately documented
3. WHEN setup instructions reference configuration files THEN all referenced files SHALL exist and be accessible
4. WHEN file paths are mentioned in documentation THEN they SHALL match the actual repository structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer reviewing the project architecture, I want accurate information about the codebase structure so that I can understand how the application is organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the README describes server.js as symlinked from src/ THEN this SHALL accurately reflect the actual file structure
2. WHEN the README lists project structure THEN it SHALL match the actual directory layout
3. WHEN code organization is described THEN it SHALL be consistent with the actual implementation
4. WHEN architectural decisions are documented THEN they SHALL reflect the current codebase state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user setting up the application, I want correct environment configuration examples so that I can properly configure the application for my environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are documented THEN they SHALL match the variables actually used in the code
2. WHEN .env file examples are provided THEN they SHALL reference files that actually exist
3. WHEN configuration options are listed THEN they SHALL be complete and accurate
4. WHEN setup instructions mention environment files THEN the correct file names SHALL be used

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working with the codebase, I want accurate npm script documentation so that I can use the correct commands for development and testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN npm scripts are documented in README THEN they SHALL match the scripts defined in package.json
2. WHEN test commands are mentioned THEN they SHALL execute successfully with the current test configuration
3. WHEN script descriptions are provided THEN they SHALL accurately describe what each script does
4. WHEN new scripts are added to package.json THEN the README SHALL be updated accordingly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user following Docker setup instructions, I want accurate Docker configuration information so that I can successfully deploy the application using containers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker Compose files are referenced THEN they SHALL exist and contain valid configuration
2. WHEN environment variables for Docker are documented THEN they SHALL match the variables used in docker-compose files
3. WHEN Docker setup steps are provided THEN they SHALL work with the actual Docker configuration
4. WHEN port configurations are mentioned THEN they SHALL be consistent across all Docker files

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer understanding the application dependencies, I want accurate Node.js version requirements so that I can ensure compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Node.js version requirements are stated THEN they SHALL be consistent with the actual application requirements
2. WHEN the README mentions Node.js 16+ THEN this SHALL be verified against the actual compatibility requirements
3. WHEN Docker configuration uses specific Node.js versions THEN the README SHALL reflect these versions accurately
4. WHEN version requirements change THEN the README SHALL be updated to match

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user troubleshooting setup issues, I want accurate troubleshooting information so that I can resolve common problems effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN troubleshooting steps are provided THEN they SHALL address actual common issues with the current codebase
2. WHEN file paths are mentioned in troubleshooting THEN they SHALL be correct for the current project structure
3. WHEN configuration issues are addressed THEN the solutions SHALL work with the current application setup
4. WHEN error scenarios are documented THEN they SHALL reflect actual error conditions users might encounter
