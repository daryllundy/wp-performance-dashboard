# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive demo WordPress MySQL database environment specifically designed to showcase the performance dashboard capabilities. The demo environment will include a fully configured WordPress installation with realistic demo data, multiple plugins, themes, and performance scenarios that demonstrate the dashboard's monitoring capabilities. This will provide users with an immediate way to explore the dashboard's features without needing to set up their own WordPress environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating the WordPress Performance Dashboard, I want a pre-configured demo environment so that I can immediately see the dashboard's capabilities without setting up my own WordPress site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the demo docker-compose file THEN the system SHALL start a complete WordPress environment with MySQL database
2. WHEN the demo environment starts THEN the system SHALL automatically populate the database with realistic demo data
3. WHEN I access the WordPress admin THEN the system SHALL have pre-installed demo plugins and themes
4. WHEN I view the performance dashboard THEN the system SHALL display meaningful performance metrics from the demo data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the demo environment to include various performance scenarios so that I can see how the dashboard handles different types of performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the demo database is populated THEN the system SHALL include slow query examples in the database
2. WHEN the demo environment runs THEN the system SHALL have plugins that generate different performance impacts
3. WHEN I monitor the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show varied response times and query patterns
4. WHEN the demo data is generated THEN the system SHALL include admin-ajax calls and database query logs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a WordPress developer, I want the demo environment to be isolated from the main application so that I can run demos without affecting my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the demo environment THEN the system SHALL use separate Docker containers from the main application
2. WHEN the demo runs THEN the system SHALL use different ports to avoid conflicts
3. WHEN I stop the demo THEN the system SHALL not affect the main application's data or configuration
4. WHEN I restart the demo THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent demo data across restarts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user presenting the dashboard, I want the demo environment to include realistic WordPress content so that the performance metrics appear authentic and meaningful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the demo WordPress is initialized THEN the system SHALL include sample posts, pages, and media
2. WHEN the demo runs THEN the system SHALL have realistic user accounts and roles
3. WHEN I browse the demo WordPress site THEN the system SHALL display a functional frontend with themes
4. WHEN the performance dashboard monitors the demo THEN the system SHALL show realistic traffic patterns and database activity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy commands to manage the demo environment so that I can quickly start, stop, and reset the demo for presentations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the demo setup command THEN the system SHALL start all required services in the correct order
2. WHEN I need to reset the demo THEN the system SHALL provide a command to restore original demo data
3. WHEN I want to stop the demo THEN the system SHALL cleanly shut down all demo services
4. WHEN I check demo status THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback on service health and readiness
