# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The WordPress Performance Dashboard has a critical auto-scrolling bug that causes the page size to grow continuously and uncontrollably. When content is updated in real-time (every 5-30 seconds), new content is being appended to scrollable containers without properly replacing or limiting the existing content, leading to memory leaks and an ever-expanding DOM. This issue primarily affects the Slow Queries and Plugin Performance sections, which accumulate data indefinitely instead of maintaining a reasonable content limit.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want content updates to replace existing content rather than continuously append new content, so that the page doesn't grow indefinitely and consume excessive memory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is updated in scrollable containers THEN the existing content SHALL be completely replaced with new content
2. WHEN new data is loaded via AJAX or real-time updates THEN the DOM size SHALL remain stable and not grow continuously
3. WHEN multiple updates occur THEN the total number of DOM elements SHALL remain within reasonable limits

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want the application to maintain consistent performance over time, so that the dashboard remains responsive even after running for extended periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard runs for extended periods THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable and not increase continuously
2. WHEN content updates occur repeatedly THEN browser performance SHALL not degrade over time
3. WHEN scrollable containers are updated THEN the total DOM node count SHALL not exceed reasonable limits (e.g., 1000 nodes per container)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want content updates to properly clean up old data, so that I always see the most current and relevant information without outdated entries accumulating.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new slow queries data is loaded THEN old query entries SHALL be removed from the DOM
2. WHEN plugin performance data is updated THEN previous plugin entries SHALL be replaced, not appended
3. WHEN content containers are refreshed THEN only the most recent data SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want the scroll position to be preserved when content is properly replaced, so that I can continue viewing the same relative position in the updated content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is replaced in scrollable containers THEN the user's scroll position SHALL be preserved relative to the content
2. WHEN the content height changes due to updates THEN the scroll position SHALL be adjusted proportionally
3. WHEN users are actively interacting with scrollable content THEN updates SHALL not disrupt their current viewing context
